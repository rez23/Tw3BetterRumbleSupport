# Better Rumble Support for The Witcher 3

This mod enhances the controller rumble support for various in-game actions and events, providing the player with a more extensive range of feedback during gameplay. All actions can be individually enabled or disabled using the menu provided by the mod.

## How To Install

Simple install using The Witcher 3 Mod Manager or copy the contents of the zip file into the main folder of the TW3 game.

## Mod Features

This mod adds rumble for various in-game actions and events. I will add more actions/events with future updates.

Controller rumble is actually enabled for:
- **Geralt attacks**
- **Geralt damages**
- **Geralt fatigue (when you cannot run or use signs)**
- **Horse speed loss**
- **Critical health**

The mod provides its own settings menu, allowing you to enable only what you want and keep the rest disabled.
